Top Cat
=======

This project helps work out what a user's favorite categories are. 
It's designed for apps like Metro 10 that have hits (e.g. reading an article) 
and misses (e.g. skipping or down voting an article). 

It uses basic probability: hits / (hits + misses). 

It adjusts probabilities to compensate for small sample sizes.
